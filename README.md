Shoe Designz is a mock e-Commerce store for shoes built using ASP.NET Core using C#.

A working progress.

## Product
* Selling Shoez!
- This mock website will simulate a shoe e-commerce store which a user will be able to register and login.

- Claims used are the user login/registration.
* Reason: The user has a more interactive experience being logged in and are able to caputure any information used for policies.

- Policies enforced are the "edu" emails.
* Reason: If the user registers with an ".edu" email (ex. student@class.edu) that user is given access to special student discounts.

- OAUTH providers currently allowed are Facebook and Microsoft.
* Twitter and Google might eventually be added.

- The user is also able to add items to shopping cart.  Checkout coming soon.
- Structure/Database Schema of the store is below
